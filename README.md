### Usage
1. **Expense Type**
  - Create the hierarchy of expense types based on your needs
  - Add an expense account for each company so it gets inherited by all new expense items

ℹ️ *Note: Expense accounts are inherited from parents.*

2. **Expense Item**
  - Create the expense items that reflect your expenses
  - Add each expense item to the expense type that it belongs to
  - Add an expense account for each company and/or set the expense defaults (cost, quantity, etc..)
  - Modify the expense defaults (cost, quantity, etc..) of the inherited expense accounts, if exist

ℹ️ *Note: Expense accounts will be inherited from linked expense type and they are not modifiable except for cost and quantity related fields.*

3. **Expense**
  - Create a company expense and select the expense item
  - Fill the cost, quantity, etc.. if not fixed for the expense item
  - Attachments can be added or removed even after submit, but before adding the expense to an expenses request

4. **Expenses Request**
  - Create a request for a company list of expenses so that it can be approved or rejected
  - When requests are rejected, the linked expenses will be automatically rejected & cancelled
  - Rejected requests can be appealed and after appealing, the status of linked expenses will be automatically restored and set as Requested

5. **Expenses Entry**
  - Create entries based on a request or manually add company related expenses
  - After submit, all the expenses will be posted to the journal

6. **Expenses Settings**
  - Enable the module (Enabled by default)
  - Modify the expense settings
  - Modify the update notification settings
  - Check for update manually

ℹ️ *Note: Module update functionality will only be enabled in the PRODUCTION stage*
